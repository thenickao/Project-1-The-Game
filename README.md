Welcome to Matching Moodiez! This is a 2-Player game where memory is key. Players will take turns matching cards. If a Player finds a match, they earn a point and get to take another turn. Once all matches have been made, the Player with the most points is declared the winner! However, if both Players have the same number of points, the game will result in a draw.<br><br>Click "Start Game" when you are ready to play!
